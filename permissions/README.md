### MODE
This number will corrispond to the permissions (RWX - Read, Write, Execute) (Binary - 111 110 100) (Decimal - 764)
NOTE: When changing or adding a mode, remember that the chmod command will override the current permissions. To avoid losing existing permissions, you need to include them in the updated mode. For example, with 764, the owner has full READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE permissions (rwx), the group has READ and WRITE permissions (rw-), and others have READ access only (r--). If I wanted to give the group EXECUTE permission as well, I would change the mode to 774 (rwx for owner, rwx for group, r-- for others).
