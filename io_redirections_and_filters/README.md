# I/O Redirection and Filters

## 0-hello_world
`echo`	- will print the string (text) that you put in between single or double quotes

## 2-hellofile
`cat`	- concatenate and print files. Effectively will showcase the files content.\
	- You can also display multiple files by incoroprating a space inbetween each file name or location.

## 4-lastlines
`tail`	- display the last part of a file.\
	- That being said the `-n` option will allow you to set the number of lines that you want to view. **Understand that the last line is considered line 1 instead of the last line**

## 5-firstlines
`head`	- Will do the same as `tail` but for the beginning of the file.

## 6-third_line
Pipe (`|`)\
- The pipe allows you to take the output of one command and pass it as input to another command\
	- *eg.* syntax structure `head -n 3 file_name | tail -n 1`\
		- `head -n 3` is like flipping to the first 3 pages of a book.\
		- `tail -n 1` then says, "Give me the last page of these 3 pages."

## 7-file
Redirection *single* (`>`)\
- **The "Redirection"** will pass the *output* before it and write it into the file.\
	- When using **redirection**, it's important to remember that the output will always go to a file and not another command.\
	- To connect or chain multiple commands, use the *pipe* (`|`) operator.\
	- *eg.* syntax structure `echo "Content of the file goes here" > file_name.txt`\
		- `echo "..."` is the command to print/display your text/string\
		- `>` will redirect that command into the file "file_name.txt"\

Redirection *double* (`>>`)\
- Double Redirection (>>) functions similarly to single redirection (>), but instead of overwriting the existing content of a file, it appends or adds new output to the end of the file.


## 9-duplicate-last-line (append/add)
- This is an extension from tasks 6 and 7. I realized that you can run a command and directly redirect its output into a file without needing an additional step to "print" or "write." Using redirection allows you to input the output results straight into a file.
	- *eg.* `ls -la > file_name.txt` would essentially print out the results in the *file_name.txt* file directly./
	*(remember that the single `>` will overwrite the content in the file if any and the `>>` will append (add) the output to the file.)*

## 10-Duplicate_last_line
`find`
- Is a search tool specifically for the command line. It searches through the directory hierarchy (the structure of folders and subfolders) based on the criteria you give it, like file names, types, or sizes.

	-  **Command Structure** *( Command -> Location -> Criteria -> Action )*
	- Example: `find /location -name '*.log' -delete`
   		- Command: `find` (search)
   		- Location: `/home/user`
    		- Criteria: `-name '*.log'` (log files)
    		- Action: `-delete` (deletes each found file)

## 11-directories
`wc`
- "Word Count" It is a command-line utility used to count various statistics from input text (*Lines, Words, Bytes(characters)*)

	-  **Command Structure** *( Command -> Option -> File )*
	- Example: `find ./* -type d -print | wc -l`
		- Command: `wc` the count command
		- Option: `-l` Lines
		- File: `file_name or input from a pipe`

## 12-newest_files

- **Complete Command**
		- `sort | uniq -u`
